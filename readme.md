I built this as a test to show JSON files as a table. I plan on expanding this project in the future where I can use it as a career mode tracker for fifa 22 since the game doesn't come with one.


If you want to do this all you need is to create a excel sheet first with these headers
Position	Name	Apperiences	Assists	Clean Sheets

I forgot to add the goals, you can do it and fill out the sheet with your own data. 
Then just goto any excel to json converter site and use that as the data.json file.
